            For a long time, it seemed as though the flexible office market could do no wrong, with rapid expansion and new companies entering the market, seemingly on a weekly basis. Then cracks began to show, and people began to question whether the market was becoming overheated.

            In real estate, size matters. With offices in particular, size affects every element of property decision-making, from assessing workspace layout and suitability to planning and predicting likely running costs, fit-out expenses and reinstatement values. It is also a crucial factor in determining the total amount of rent an occupier will pay.

            The big story, of course, was, and still is, WeWork. The flexible office behemoth had been lauded for its rapid growth and its charismatic leader, Adam Neumann. However, having filed the papers for its initial public offering (IPO), in August last year, the company abandoned its plans after failing to attract sufficient investor interest. It was a huge climbdown and led to Neumann’s resignation. Analysts suggested that the company was running out of cash, but at the end of October it was announced that Japanese investor Softbank had agreed to stump up $5bn in new financing in  exchange for an overall 80% stake in the business (it already owned a third).

        <p class="para">
            WeWork’s latest financials appear to justify investor hesitancy: in November last year, it revealed an unadjusted loss of $1.25bn in the third quarter of 2019, up from $497m in the same period in 2018. The figures also showed that its occupancy rate was 79% – the lowest since mid-2017. However, WeWork wasn’t the only flexible office operator suffering in late 2019. In October, Central Working fell into administration, joining The Clubhouse, which was bought up by Regus owner IWG. And there was Second Home, the company set up by Rohan Silva, a former adviser to David Cameron, which had to seek new funding after suffering cost overruns on its first US development.
