                                For a long time, it seemed as though the flexible office market could do no wrong, with rapid expansion and new companies entering the market, seemingly on a weekly basis. Then cracks began to show, and people began to question whether the market was becoming overheated.

                                In real estate, size matters. With offices in particular, size affects every element of property decision-making, from assessing workspace layout and suitability to planning and predicting likely running costs, fit-out expenses and reinstatement values. It is also a crucial factor in determining the total amount of rent an occupier will pay.

While there is a broadly accepted definition for each basis of measurement, the way it is applied can often be quite inconsistent. So with multiple methods and interpretations for measurement, comparing properties can often be challenging, and decision-making is then neither transparent nor quick. To give an example, one landlord may choose to measure their property on a net basis, that is 100 per cent efficiency, quoting HK$1,075/m2. Another landlord may also be quoting the same rate for the same quoted area, but they measure their property on a gross basis with a 60 per cent efficiency. Effectively, this means that while the unit rate and the quoted area are the same, the actual price you are paying for the useable space in the second property is around HK$1,795/m2.

                            With different efficiencies being quoted for different buildings, you cannot compare properties using the unit rate without first having made a number of adjustments to the figures. Another example of where confusion may arise is when occupiers are looking at property options. Due to the different methods of measurement that have been applied, an occupier looking for cost savings may end up taking an office at a higher unit rate than they are currently paying, or an occupier looking for a larger office may actually end up in a space that quotes a smaller area than that of their existing premises, although in actual fact it is physically larger.
